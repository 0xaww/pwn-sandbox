What is this?
=====================

Pwn-Sandbox is a sandbox tool for pwner to protect your own gamebox on AWD CTF Challenges.

What can this do?
=====================

1. Protect sensitive syscall like fork, execve, clone etc.
2. Record traffic from other teams.

How to use this?
=====================

Add "-orig" postfix to original binary name and change pwn-sandbox to original binary name. 
Traffic and syscall will log into /tmp/.binaryname/ directory. timestamp-std is stdin/stdout log, timestamp-n is other fds' log, timestamp-syscall is syscall log.

How this thing work?
=====================

See ptrace(3) for more details.

Build from source.
=====================

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install (*Optional, this binary will not install to system dir.)

It is better to build with static link to prevent libc difference between gamebox and your own system. Use ./configure LDFLAGS=-static to enable it.
